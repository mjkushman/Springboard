<!--  Part 1: Number Facts

1. Make a request to the Numbers API (http://numbersapi.com/) to get a fact about your favorite number. (Make sure you get back JSON by including the json query key, specific to this API. [Details](http://numbersapi.com/#json).
2. Figure out how to get data on multiple numbers in a single request. Make that request and when you get the data back, put all of the number facts on the page.
3. Use the API to get 4 facts on your favorite number. Once you have them all, put them on the page. It’s okay if some of the facts are repeats.
    
    *(Note: You’ll need to make multiple requests for this.)*
